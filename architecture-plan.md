# PPT to Engaging Audio Converter Architecture Plan

## System Overview

Convert PowerPoint presentations into engaging audio content with AI-generated voices and enhanced narrative structure.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Storage Layer
- **Database**: MongoDB (already integrated)
  - Store presentation metadata
  - Track conversion status
  - Save generated audio segments
  - Store user feedback and ratings

### 2. Backend Services

#### PPT Processing Service
- Convert PPT to structured content using python-pptx
- Extract text, notes, and slide structure
- Maintain slide hierarchy and formatting context

#### Content Enhancement Service
- Use OpenAI GPT-4 for content transformation:
  - Convert bullet points into conversational narrative
  - Add transitional phrases between slides
  - Generate engaging introductions and summaries
  - Maintain professional tone while being engaging

#### Audio Generation Service
- Use ElevenLabs API (already integrated) for natural voice synthesis
  - Support multiple voice profiles for variety
  - Add appropriate pauses and emphasis
  - Include subtle background music (optional)
  - Handle pronunciation of technical terms

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Upload Interface
- Drag-and-drop PPT upload
- Progress tracking
- Format validation

#### Audio Player
- Slide-synchronized playback
- Interactive transcript
- Voice speed control
- Navigation markers for slides
- Feedback mechanism (thumbs up/down)

#### Settings Panel
- Voice selection
- Style preferences (formal vs conversational)
- Background music toggle
- Language preferences

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Enhance PPT converter to extract structured content
2. Implement content enhancement pipeline with OpenAI
3. Set up audio generation workflow with ElevenLabs
4. Create basic feedback storage system

### Phase 2: Audio Enhancement
1. Implement dynamic voice modulation
2. Add background music integration
3. Develop content pacing algorithm
4. Create audio quality monitoring system

### Phase 3: User Experience
1. Build interactive audio player
2. Implement real-time conversion status
3. Add feedback collection system
4. Create analytics dashboard

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express (existing)
- Python for PPT processing (existing)
- MongoDB for storage (existing)
- OpenAI GPT-4 API (existing)
- ElevenLabs API (existing)

### Frontend
- React (existing)
- TailwindCSS (existing)
- Web Audio API for advanced playback
- IndexedDB for offline support

## API Endpoints

### Conversion API
```
POST /api/convert
- Upload PPT file
- Specify conversion preferences

GET /api/status/:id
- Check conversion progress
- Get error details if any

GET /api/audio/:id
- Stream converted audio
- Get synchronized transcript
```

### Feedback API
```
POST /api/feedback
- Submit user ratings
- Store improvement suggestions

GET /api/analytics
- Get conversion statistics
- View feedback summary
```

## Security Considerations

1. File validation and sanitization
2. Rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Audio content encryption
4. User authentication for feedback
5. API key security for third-party services

## Scalability Considerations

1. Implement job queue for conversions
2. Use caching for frequently accessed audio
3. Implement content CDN for audio delivery
4. Design for horizontal scaling
5. Implement retry mechanisms for API calls

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve architecture plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish testing framework
5. Create deployment pipeline
